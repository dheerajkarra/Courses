# Week 1 - Foundations of GenAI and Prompt Engineering

This module introduces the basics of generative AI and provides an overview of the most common tools, frameworks, and models used in AI development. You'll learn fundamental prompt engineering principles that help maximize AI model capabilities through thoughtful input design. Special emphasis is placed on the LangChain frameworkâ€”its features, benefits, and role in designing and writing AI applications. The module covers practical techniques for creating reusable prompt templates that improve consistency, implementing in-context learning strategies, and optimizing AI responses through iterative prompt refinement.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe common tools and frameworks in AI development
* Explain the role and importance of prompt engineering in AI applications
* Apply different in-context learning techniques along with prompt engineering to enhance application responses
* Design and implement prompt templates with LangChain

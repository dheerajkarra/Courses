# Week 3 - Build a GenAI Application with LangChain

In this module, you’ll build a Flask web app that uses the power of generative AI using LangChain. You’ll learn how to integrate AI into your application, leverage LangChain’s JsonOutputParser to produce structured outputs, and fine-tune prompt engineering to generate actionable JSON responses. Along the way, you’ll compare and evaluate different language models—including Llama 3, Granite, and Mixtral—to discover which best suits your needs.

## Learning Objectives

* Incorporate AI capabilities into a Flask web application that contains interactive features
* Use LangChain’s JsonOutputParser to transform AI outputs into clean, structured JSON data
* Craft prompts that generate actionable and reliable JSON responses
* Integrate and analyze the performance of Llama 3, Granite, and Mixtral to choose the most suitable model for your project

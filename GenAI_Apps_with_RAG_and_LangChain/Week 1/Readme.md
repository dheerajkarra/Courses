# Module 1 - Document loader using LangChain

In this module, you will learn all about document loaders from LangChain and then use that knowledge to load your document from various sources. You will also explore the various text splitting strategies with RAG and LangChain and apply them to enhance model responsiveness. Hands-on labs will provide you an opportunity to practice loading documents as well as implement the text-splitting techniques you have learned.

## Learning Objectives

* Describe what document loaders from LangChain are and how they can be used.
* Explain techniques for splitting text using RAG and LangChain.
* Use LangChain to load documents from various sources such as PDF, CSV, URLs, and text.
* Apply text splitting techniques with RAG and LangChain to enhance model responsiveness.

### Assignment

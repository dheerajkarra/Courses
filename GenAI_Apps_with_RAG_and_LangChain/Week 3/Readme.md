# Module 3 - Create a QA Bot to read your document

In this module, you will learn how to implement RAG to improve retrieval. You will become familiar with Gradio and how to set up a simple Gradio interface to interact with your models. You will also learn how to construct a QA bot to answer questions from loaded documents using LangChain and LLMs. Using hands-on labs, you will have the opportunity to practice setting up a Gradio interface, as well as constructing a QA bot. In the final project, you will build an AI application using RAG and LangChain.

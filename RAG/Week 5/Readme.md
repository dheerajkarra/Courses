# Week 5 - RAG Systems in Production

Learn how to monitor and evaluate a RAG system both at the component level and end-to-end and consider the tradeoffs in system performance, cost, capability, and security faced by production RAG systems.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what qualities make production environments challenging for RAG systems
* Design an observability, monitoring, and experimentation system for a production RAG system using an observability platform
* Select the appropriate tradeoff of cost and latency vs quality in a production RAG system and explain strategies that can be used to achieve the appropriate balance for a given project
* Explain security concerns inherent to any RAG system and how they can be mitigated
* Explain the design and benefits of a multimodal RAG system

# Week 4 - LLMs and Text Generation

Learn all about large language models, how they work, as well as techniques like prompt engineering, hallucination detection, agentic system design, and fine-tuning, to further improve their performance in a RAG system.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the components of a transformer and how they impact the operation of an LLM inside a RAG system
* Choose the appropriate LLM for a project based on qualities like cost, context window, knowledge cutoff, and performance on LLM benchmarks
* Explain the operation of techniques including LLM sampling strategies, prompt engineering, and hallucination detection, and evaluate how best to use these techniques inside a RAG system
* Identify the benefits of agentic workflows or fine-tuned LLMs and assess when they could be used to improve the performance of a RAG system
* Build a RAG system that uses a variety of advanced techniques to improve the quality of an LLM's performance

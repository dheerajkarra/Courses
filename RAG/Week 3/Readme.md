# Week 3 - Information Retrieval with Vector Databases

Learn how vector databases scale up search and techniques to improve retrieval, such as chunking, query parsing, and reranking.

## Learning Objectives

* Compare K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms and justify why vector databases are designed to implement ANN approaches.
* Perform common operations with a vector database including loading and indexing data and performing a wide variety of searches
* Compare a variety of strategies for chunking, query parsing, and reranking, and weigh when more basic versus more advanced approaches make the most sense to use in a production RAG system
* Build a RAG system based around a vector database that uses chunking, query parsing, and reranking

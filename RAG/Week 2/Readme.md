# Week 2 - Information Retrieval and Search Foundations

Learn foundational information retrieval techniques, including keyword search, semantic search, and metadata filtering. Then build and evaluate a hybrid search pipeline that combines all three techniques.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the operation of keyword search, semantic search, and metadata filtering, and compare their strengths and shortcomings
* Describe the high level architecture of a retriever and the way hybrid search combines the strengths of multiple retrieval techniques
* Use a variety of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of a retriever
* Implement keyword search, semantic search, and metadata filtering in Python and tune their performance
